# 3D-Snake
A 3-D OpenGL game with texture mapping.
### Essential Requirements
1. Object Oriented Design.
2. Six different faces that complete each other as a textured skybox for the project’s environment.
3. Dividing the ground into 2D Grid surrounded with walls.
4. Using basic model for:

        a. Snake consists of head and rest of its body.
        b. Walls.
        c. Food.
(Ex: a cube or pyramid with special texture for each model).

5. Using and manipulating a Third Person Camera “TPC” to follow Snake head.
6. Basic Collision Detection between:

        a. Snake head & Wall: Snake head can’t move through a Wall.
        b. Snake head & Snake body: Snake head can’t move through its body.
        c. Snake head & Food: Food Disappears if Snake head collided with it.
        
7. Using a pin point light source.
8. Food should appear randomly in the Grid.
9. Collecting Food increase Snake size.
10. Snake dies, If it collided with a Wall or its body.
11. Snake moves by default, but you change its direction left and right by a keypress.

### Bonus
1. Design more than one level (4-Levels).
2. Animation that takes a certain period of time. (Dance).
3. Building a more complex Maze. (Bigger Maze).
4. GUI Menus. (Start Menu).
5. Sound.
6. Special Food.
